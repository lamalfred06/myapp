git crash course

played from x1carbon git-bash

This line is added by cloned copy of repository, then pushed back to parent
at WorkAndHints/git/myapp
Added this line from commandline project (not IDEA project) and commited and pushed
Add from IDE when there was concurrent adding line from another clone already, conflict resolution required when trying to git push origin
